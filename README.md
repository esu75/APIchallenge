# APIchallenge
This challenge has me to check the weather conditon between the ranges of north and south poles using the latitude and longitude data. I found out that the temperature is higher as the coordinates gets closer to the equator ( zero degree). Hummidty, cloudiness, and windspeed increase as we go towards north from south.

The second part is to look for vacation hotels in cities that I think have ideal weather conditions. I was able to put all in a map.
